    <h1>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h1>
    <h2>A Scandal in Bohemia</h2>
    <p>To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.</p>
    <p>It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.</p>
    <p>He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.</p>
    
    <h2>The Red-Headed League</h2>
    <p>I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.</p>
    <p>With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.</p>
    <p>"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially.</p>
    
    <h2>A Case of Identity</h2>
    <p>"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent."</p>
    <p>We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outr√© results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.</p>
