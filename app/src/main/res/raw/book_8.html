    <h1>The Hobbit</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1: An Unexpected Party</h2>
    <p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.</p>

    <p>It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 2: Roast Mutton</h2>
    <p>Up jumped Bilbo, and taking the dwarves at their word that they would come back later, he ran along the passage, very angry, and altogether confused and bewuthered—this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered.</p>
