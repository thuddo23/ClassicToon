    <h1>Pride and Prejudice</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
    <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
    <p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.</p>
    <p>It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:</p>
    <p>"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <p>Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.</p>
    <p>They attacked him in various waysâ€”with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.</p>
