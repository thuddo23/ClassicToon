    <h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've carried with me ever since.</p>
    <p>"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."</p>
    <p>He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.</p>
    
    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <p>About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land.</p>
    <p>This is a valley of ashesâ€”a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.</p>
